## Description 
The goal of this project was to refactor an existing book search application to include a GraphQL API in place of an existing RESTful API. The application allows users to search for books using google's book search API and save them to their user's profile.

## Installation
Click this link to view the deployed application: 

## Usage
To use this application, click the provided link in the Installation section of the README. The first page you see will be the home search page. Here, you will see a search input field. Using it will populate the page with several search results based on input. The user can save the book if they are logged in. Click the Login/Sign Up nav link in the top right to open up to a login modal. Selecting 'Sign Up' will allow a user to create a new account. Once logged in, a user will now be able to save books they search for.
